# euclid4max
A small library of javascripts and maxpats for generating Euclidean Rhythms in Max

Euclish.js is a wonky attempt at the algorithm.

Euclid2.js produces a simple array of maximally even rhythm.

Euclid3.js does the same, but then allows you to space and rotate the rhythms however you like.


Maxpats store the rhythms in a multislider, which can be used for rhythm triggers using the counter provided.

For lk.euclid, input the 5 specified values through a [pak 0 0 0 0 0] as shown.

For the three other maxpats, use a [pak 0 0] for total beats and number of groups.
